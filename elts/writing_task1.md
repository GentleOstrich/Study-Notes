## Line graph

make a very general 

highest overall

compares lines at special points: write at least one thing about each line

### Example

> The graph below shows electricity production (in terawatt hours) in France between 1980 and 2012.

The line graph compares electricty produced by four XXX in France during the 32 years.

*The line graph compares **the amount of electricity produced** in France using four different **sources of** power over a period of 32 years.*

(I wrote) (The electricity produced using Nuclear saw a huge increasenment during the 36 years and continues having a dominant status nowadays. Another three kept more stable trend compared to Nuclear.)

*It is clear that nuclear power was **by far the most important** **means of electricity generation** **over the peroid shown**. Renewables **provided** the lowest amount of electricity in each year.*

*In 1980, thermal power stations were **the main source of electricity** in France, **generating** around 120 terawatt hours of power. Nuclear and hydroelectriv power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount. Just one year later, nuclear power **overtook** the thermal power **as the primary source of electricity***

*Between 1980 and 2005, electricity provided by nuclear power **rose dramatically to the peak of** 430 terawatt hours. **By contrast**, **the figure of** thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985, and **remained at this level for the rest of the period**. Hydroelectric power **generation** remained **relatively stable**, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32 years, but renewable electricity production **saw only a small rise** to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.* 

### Vocabulary

remained at this level for the rest of the period 涨完不变了，不变了就可以写这句

The figure of something fluctuated in comparison with other three sectors.

## Bar chart

make a very general comparion (overview)

compare specific numbers (details)

### Example

> The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.

The bar chart compares the number of units sold  worldwide by five most famous manufacturers in 2009, 2011 and 2013. 

*The bar chart compares the number of mobile phone sold worldwide by the five most popoular manufacturers **in the years of 2009, 2011 and 2013**.*

Nokia sold the most ~~of~~ mobile phones in 2009 and 2011, before being token over by Samsung. Samsung and Apple saw a dramatical rise during the three years.

 (something become best)

*It is clear that Nokia sold the most mobile phones between 2009 and 2011, but Samsung became the best selling brand in 2013. Samsung and Appple saw the biggest rises **in sales** over the 5-year period.*

In 2009, Nokia sold more than 400 millions of units, which was almost double the number of handsets sold by the second successful manufacturer, Samsung. However, Nokia's sales figure fell by approximately 200 million units, dramatically after 4 years, while Samsung sold most mobile phones in 2013.

*In 2009, Nokia sold close to 450 million mobile phones, which was **almost double** the number of handsets sold by the **second most successful** manufacturer, Samsung. **Over the following four years**, however, Nokia's sales figures **fell by** approximately 200 million units, **whereas** Samsung saw sales rise by a similar amount. By 2013, Samsung **had become the market leader** with sales **reaching** 450 million units.*

Apple, LG and ZTE sold much less phones than Nokia and Samsung over the period shown. The sales figure of Apple rose a bit during the 4 years, from about 20 millions units to 150 million units, while LG's sales figure fell by 50 millions. ZTE's sales figure rose a bit, too.

*The other three top selling mobile phone brand between 2009 and 2013 were LG, ZTE and APPLE. In 2009, these companies sold **around** 125 million, 50 million and 25 million mobile handsets respectively, but Apple overtook the other two vendors in 2011. In 2013, **purchases of Apple handsets reached 150 million units**, while LG **saw declining sales** and the figures for ZTE rose only slightly.*

## Pie chart

### Example

> The charts below show household spending patterns in two countries between 1980 and 2008.

*The pie chart compares the proportion of five categories of household expenditure in two countries in the years 1980 and 2008.* 

It is clear that both in the two countries, the percentage of Food & drink saw a decrease, from 23% to 13% and from 29% to 25% respectively. The proportion of Utility bills rose a bit, reaching around 30% both int the two countries.

（overview不能提及数字啊）

*It is **noticeable** that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, UK residents spent a **significantly larger** percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand **conterparts**.*

（直接说哪年怎么样就得了）

In 1980, **29% of an average New Zealand househole budget ==went on==** food and drink, while **the equivalent figure** for a UK home wa 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had **fallen by 4%** in New Zealand, and by a full 10% in the UK. By contrast, both contries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, 23% to 13% and from 29% to 25% respectively. 

**Leisure activities** **accounted for** the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest spending in New Zealand. **In fact, in 2008**, New Zealanders **spent only half as much in relative terms** on recreatoin (17%) as UK residents (34%).  In both countries, transport costs and other costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

## Table

### Example

> The table below shows statistics about the top five countries for international tourism in 2012 and 2013.

The table compares the number of tourists and the tourists spending of    the most popular countries in the years of 2012 and 2013.

*The table compares the **five highest ranking countries** **in terms of** the numbers of visits and the money spent by tourist over a period of two years.*

*It is clear that France was **the world's most popular tourist destination** in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA earned by far **the most revenue** from tourism over the same period.*

*In 2012, 83 million tourists visited France, **and** the USA was the second most visited country, with 66.7 million tourists. Spain and China  each received just under 68 million visitors, **while** Italy was ranked fifth with 46.4 million tourists. 2013 saw a rise of between 1 and 4 million tourist visits to each country, with the exception of China, which received 2 million fewer visitors than in the previous year.*

Spending by tourists visiting the USA increased from \$126.2 billion in 2012 to \$139.6 billion in 2013, and these figures were well over twice as high as those for any other country. Spain received the second highest amounts of tourist, followed by France, China and Italy. Interestingly, despite falling numbers of tourists, Chinese revenue from tourism rose by \$1.7 billion in 2013.
